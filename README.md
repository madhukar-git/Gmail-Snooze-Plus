# Gmail-Snooze-Plus

##Enhances Gmail experience by allowing the user to  snooze an email.  

Snoozing is the process of assigning a snooze label to your email. When the snooze for that email expires, it will be marked as unread email in your inbox.
Gmail-Snooze-Plus comes with two features:
###  _Snooze for certain number of days_
##### If user wants to snooze for N days, he must  assign  a predefined label Zzz/N d.  All the predefined labels can be configured during installation of this program.
###  _Snooze until certain date_
##### For this, manually create a label to the email in the format  MonthNumber-DayNumber. For example, if you want an email to show up as unread in your inbox on July 4th, create a label 7-4 and assign to this email.

###How it works?
It works using Google Apps Script, a JavaScript-based scripting language that you can set to add special functionality to your Google applicationsâ€”including Gmail, Docs, Calendar, Contacts, and more. The beauty of Apps Scripts is that they run in the cloud, independent of any extension or third-party service, meaning you don't need to install anything special and you don't have to worry about handing your private communication over to another service.

###How to install?
This script is an extension to the original one mentioned in this Google's blog post which can be found here: http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/gmail-snooze-with-apps-script.html.
Follow those install instructions along with the repository's script for added features!
